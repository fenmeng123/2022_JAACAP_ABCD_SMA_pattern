Codes for the manuscript, entitled "Youth Screen Media Activity Patterns and Associations with Behavioral Developmental Measures and Resting-state Brain Functional Connections".
According to the ABCD Data Use of Certification (DUC), we cannot make some of the intermeidate data public. If any one want to use the ABCD data or replicate findings in this manuscript, it would be better to apply the ABCD data through the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) with the DUC signed by yourself/your institution.

For more details about the analyses in this manuscript, please see the supplemental materials.

### Res_1_Logs
TXT-format analysis log files (auto-generated by MATLAB codes)
### Res_2_Results
Analses results from MATLAB and R.
### Res_3_IntermediateData
Intermediate data from the raw ABCD V4.0 release tabulated data
### Step_1_ClusterAnalysis
cluster analysis (unsupervised machine learning analysis) in this manuscript
K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering were performed by MATLAB. Latent profile analysis was performed by R. This folder also included the sensitivity analysis part(i.e. subsample clustering).
### Step_2_CrossSectional
Cross-sectional for ABCD baseline wave data, which mainly included the cross-sectional three-level linear-mixed-effect (LME) modeling. The demographic table (table 1) were generated by codes in this folder.
### Step_3_Longitudinal
Longitudinal analysis for ABCD baseline, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up wave. Implemented by three-level conditional growth LME model.
### Step_4_Visualization
Codes generate all figures in this manuscript and supplemental materials.
### subfunctions
All subfunctions serve the analysis. If you want to run any code in above mentioned folders, please _add path_ this folder (subfunctions) to your MATLAB environment path befor you run any scripts.
